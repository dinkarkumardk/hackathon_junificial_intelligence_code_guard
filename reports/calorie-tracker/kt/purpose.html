    <h1>Purpose, Key Goals, and Stakeholders</h1>
    <p>The project involves various files in a NestJS application, each serving a specific purpose. These include handling HTTP requests, managing user authentication and calorie tracking, providing basic examples of services, extracting user information, and ensuring only authenticated users can access certain routes. Other files manage operations related to calories, structure 'Calorie' data, and handle authentication using Google's OAuth2 service. Some files ensure data received for creating or retrieving calorie information is valid and in the correct format. The project also includes files that initialize the application, set global configurations, and manage user data. The primary users are developers building or maintaining the application, and indirectly, end users who interact with the application. The main objectives are to enhance user experience, improve code readability and maintainability, enhance security, and ensure efficient data operations.</p><ul><li>The project involves various files in a NestJS application, each serving a specific purpose.
