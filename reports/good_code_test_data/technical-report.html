    <td class="score tooltip">70.0
        <span class="tooltiptext">The code is generally safe from common security vulnerabilities like injection attacks, but it lacks proper logging and error handling mechanisms. Additionally, it does not sanitize or validate the input data, which could potentially lead to security issues.</span>
