## Overview
A minimal code analysis tool that scores code files and generates technical & non-technical HTML reports. All code processing, scoring, and report generation use OpenAI APIs. No other dependencies.

### QA Use Cases
- **Test Planning**: Prioritize testing efforts based on code quality scores and identified issues
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk code areas that require more thorough testing
- **Regression Testing Focus**: Target testing on files with lower quality scores or recent changes
- **Code Coverage Analysis**: Understand which areas of code may need additional test coverage
- **Bug Prediction**: Use quality metrics to predict potential areas where bugs might occur


## QA Automation Strategy

### Automated Test Planning
- **Threshold-Based Prioritization**: Automatically flag files with scores below 70 for intensive testing
- **Risk Matrix Generation**: Create automated risk assessment matrices based on quality scores
- **Test Case Assignment**: Auto-assign test cases based on identified code issues and complexity scores
- **Integration with Test Management Tools**: Export prioritized file lists to tools like TestRail, Jira, or Azure DevOps

### Automated Risk Assessment
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up scheduled scans to monitor code quality changes
- **Delta Analysis**: Compare quality scores between releases to identify regression risks
- **Automated Alerts**: Send notifications when code quality drops below defined thresholds
- **Risk Dashboard**: Generate real-time dashboards showing high-risk areas across the codebase

### Regression Testing Automation
- **Smart Test Selection**: Automatically select regression tests based on files with quality score changes
- **Impact Analysis**: Map code quality changes to existing test suites for targeted execution
- **Test Execution Triggers**: Trigger specific test suites when quality scores indicate potential issues
- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Track quality degradation patterns to predict future regression areas

### Code Coverage Integration
- **Coverage Gap Identification**: Cross-reference low-quality code areas with test coverage reports
- **Automated Coverage Reports**: Generate combined quality + coverage reports for comprehensive analysis
- **Missing Test Alerts**: Automatically identify critical code paths lacking adequate test coverage
- **Coverage Target Setting**: Set automated coverage goals based on code quality scores

### Bug Prediction Automation
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use historical quality scores and bug data to build prediction models
- **Proactive Bug Detection**: Flag potential bug-prone areas before they reach production
- **Automated Bug Triage**: Pre-classify potential bugs based on code quality patterns
- **Quality-Bug Correlation Reports**: Generate reports showing correlation between quality scores and actual bugs
